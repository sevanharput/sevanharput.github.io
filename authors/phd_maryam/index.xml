      <description>&lt;p&gt;The aim of Maryam&amp;rsquo;s research project is to develop a novel therapeutic method by combining ultrasound and microwave imaging modalities to activate nanodroplets. Microwave imaging is an emerging technology that shows potential for healthcare diagnostic applications and therapy particularly for brain and breast cancer detection. Ultrasound on the other hand is a well-established method in the clinic, but the use of nanodroplets with ultrasound is only demonstrated in research settings. This project will employ both of these modalities and use nanodroplets as therapeutic agents for the treatment of brain tumours. The effect of ultrasound and microwaves has not been demonstrated for simultaneous activation and imaging of nanodroplets.&lt;/p&gt;
