      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sevan leads the SPE3D (/speed/) Ultrasound research lab, which aims to develop new imaging and sensing technologies using acoustic waves at ultrasonic frequencies. Current research projects focus on high frame-rate ultrasound imaging, super-resolution methods, 3D ultrasound imaging, signal processing for biomedical imaging, ultrasound sensor modelling and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sevan started his research career during his MSc while developing an acoustic imaging device to provide mobility aid for visually impaired people. He earned his PhD in Electronic and Electrical Engineering by implementing coded excitation methods for soft-tissue, hard-tissue and contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging. As a research fellow at University of Leeds, he worked on the development of a new transducer technology for the Sound Bullets project. Later, he conducted his postdoctoral research at Imperial College London and King&amp;rsquo;s College London (visiting researcher) working on 2D and 3D ultrasound super-resolution imaging.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;David works on the &amp;ldquo;Pre-operative breast coil sensing with ultrasound&amp;rdquo; project. Wire localization is a standard pre-operative procedure used to facilitate the localization of tumours in breast cancer patients. This method has many well documented disadvantages, the reason why non-wire alternatives are needed. Sara&amp;rsquo;s project investigates the development of a hardware that can detect metallic markers and find tiny cancers to guide the surgeon during cancer removal surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The problem Jereome wants to solve is that there is no way of non-destructive imaging of the internal structure of Antarctic ice cores, a unique and important resource for understanding climate data. The project tries to achive this by applying recent technological advances from biomedical imaging: multisensor arrays, high levels of stacking, and modern analysis techniques for the large data sets which are produced by this approach.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The aim of Maryam&amp;rsquo;s research project is to develop a novel therapeutic method by combining ultrasound and microwave imaging modalities to activate nanodroplets. Microwave imaging is an emerging technology that shows potential for healthcare diagnostic applications and therapy particularly for brain and breast cancer detection. Ultrasound on the other hand is a well-established method in the clinic, but the use of nanodroplets with ultrasound is only demonstrated in research settings. This project will employ both of these modalities and use nanodroplets as therapeutic agents for the treatment of brain tumours. The effect of ultrasound and microwaves has not been demonstrated for simultaneous activation and imaging of nanodroplets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mishal works on the development of a screening tool to detect accumulated hydrogen gas in sealed nuclear waste containers. The project aims to construct experimental test apparatus that can br fitted with an ultrasonic/acoustic sensor array. Use this sensor array to obtain data to characterise the frequency response for estimation of internal gas concentration and pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
