However, 3-D super-resolution ultrasound imaging using a full 2-D array requires a system with large number of independent channels, the design of which might be impractical due to the high cost, complexity, and volume of data produced. In this study, a 2-D sparse array was designed and fabricated with 512 elements chosen from a density-tapered 2-D spiral layout. High frame rate volumetric imaging was performed using two synchronized ULA-OP 256 research scanners. Volumetric images were constructed by coherently compounding 9-angle plane waves acquired at a pulse repetition frequency of 4500 Hz. Localization-based 3-D super-resolution images of two touching sub-wavelength tubes were generated from 6000 volumes acquired in 12 seconds. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the feasibility of 3-D super-resolution imaging and super-resolved velocity mapping using a customized 2-D sparse array transducer.","tags":null,"title":"3-D Super-Resolution Ultrasound Imaging with a 2-D Sparse Array","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"It is a very friendly environment.

If, in consecutive frames, there was more than 50% deviation in volume size between the microbubble echoes, that velocity track was replaced with the next closest microbubble pair after the same size comparison. To accelerate the tracking, a search window was set to allow a maximum microbubble velocity of 100 mm/s, which is larger than the velocity profile expected in human microcirculation.\nVelocity maps can easily distinguish opposing flow directions and separate adjacent vessels according to their speed distribution. Therefore, velocity tracking enables further differentiation between vessels otherwise not spatially separated in the image.

Ultrasound sensing can offer a bone monitoring method that is safe, practical and quantitative, so that it can be used for prognosis and during the personalized treatment process as frequently as necessary.\nAim: Develop a new method on “Bone characterization with acoustic and ultrasound waves” for measuring BMD. Commercial ultrasound scanners are designed for soft-tissue imaging and their performance is poor for hard-tissue imaging due to its different biomechanics. The opportunity here is that bone tissue allows the propagation of surface waves for longer distances unlike soft-tissue. Instead of designing an expensive imaging system, by strategically placing ultrasound sensors at certain locations valuable information can be acquired by several transducers.

It is possible to overcome this resolution limitation by localizing individual microbubbles through multiple frames and forming a superresolved image, which usually requires seconds to minutes of acquisition. Over this time interval, motion is inevitable and tissue movement is typically a combination of large- and small-scale tissue translation and deformation. Therefore, super-resolution (SR) imaging is prone to motion artifacts as other imaging modalities based on multiple acquisitions are. This paper investigates the feasibility of a two-stage motion estimation method, which is a combination of affine and nonrigid estimation, for SR US imaging. First, the motion correction accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated using simulations with increasing complexity of motion. A mean absolute error of 12.2 μm was achieved in simulations for the worst-case scenario. The motion correction algorithm was then applied to a clinical data set to demonstrate its potential to enable in vivo SR US imaging in the presence of patient motion. The size of the identified microvessels from the clinical SR images was measured to assess the feasibility of the two-stage motion correction method, which reduced the width of the motion-blurred microvessels to approximately 1.5-fold.","tags":null,"title":"Two-Stage Motion Correction for Super-Resolution Ultrasound Imaging in Human Lower Limb","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1509516299,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509516299,"objectID":"49797456d1edd6d885f3cd8b20c08bc5","permalink":"/publication/granular_chains/","publishdate":"2017-11-01T16:04:59+10:00","relpermalink":"/publication/granular_chains/","section":"publication","summary":"Wave propagation in granular chains is subject to dispersive effects as well as nonlinear effects arising from the Hertzian contact law. This enables the formation of wideband pulses, which is a desirable feature in the context of diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound applications. However, coupling of the ultrasonic energy from a chain of spheres into biological tissue is a big challenge. In order to improve the energy transfer efficiency into biological materials, a matching layer is required. A prototype device is designed to address this by using six aluminum spheres and a vitreous carbon matching layer. The matching layer and the precompression force are selected specifically to maximize the acoustic pressure in water and its bandwidth. The designed device generates a train of wideband ultrasonic pulses from a narrow-band input with a center frequency of 73 kHz. An analytical model is created to simulate the behavior of a matching layer as a flexible thin plate clamped from the edges. This model is then verified using free-field hydrophone measurements in water, which successfully predict the increased bandwidth by generation of harmonics. The shapes of the measured and predicted waveforms are compared by calculating the normalized cross-correlation, which shows 83% similarity between both. Since the generation of harmonics is of interest in this study, the total harmonic distortion (THD) and the −6 dB bandwidth of the signals are used to analyze signal fidelity between the hydrophone measurements and the model predictions. The acoustic signals in water have a root-mean-square THD of 73%, and the model predicts a root-mean-square THD of 78%. The −6 dB bandwidths of individual pulses measured by a hydrophone and predicted with the model are 280 and 252 kHz, respectively. At these high ultrasonic frequencies, it is an experimental demonstration of resonant chains operating in water with a matching layer.","tags":null,"title":"Generation of Ultrasound Pulses in Water Using Granular Chains with a Finite Matching Layer","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1385877899,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1385877899,"objectID":"248423509191a0781b09a756d6253250","permalink":"/publication/subharmonic/","publishdate":"2013-12-01T16:04:59+10:00","relpermalink":"/publication/subharmonic/","section":"publication","summary":"Subharmonic generation from ultrasound contrast agents depends on the spectral and temporal properties of the excitation signal. The subharmonic response can be improved by using wideband and long-duration signals. However, for sinusoidal tone-burst excitation, the effective bandwidth of the signal is inversely proportional to the signal duration. Linear frequency-modulated (LFM) and nonlinear frequencymodulated (NLFM) chirp excitations allow independent control over the signal bandwidth and duration; therefore, in this study LFM and NLFM signals were used for the insonation of microbubble populations. The amplitude modulation of the excitation waveform was achieved by applying different window functions. A customized window was designed for the NLFM chirp excitation by focusing on reducing the spectral leakage at the subharmonic frequency and increasing the subharmonic generation from microbubbles. Subharmonic scattering from a microbubble population was measured for various excitation signals and window functions. At a peak negative pressure of 600 kPa, the generated subharmonic energy by ultrasound contrast agents was 15.4 dB more for NLFM chirp excitation with 40% fractional bandwidth when compared with tone-burst excitation. For this reason, the NLFM chirp with a customized window was used as an excitation signal to perform subharmonic imaging in an ultrasound flow phantom.

A delay-line transducer with a working frequency of 15 MHz is chosen to achieve a minimum resolvable distance of 400 μm in human enamel. To confirm the contact between the tooth and the transducer, a verification technique based on the phase shift upon reflection is used. Because of the high attenuation in human teeth, linear frequency-modulated chirp excitation and pulse compression are exploited to increase the penetration depth and improve the SNR. Preliminary measurements show that the enamel-dentin boundary creates numerous internal reflections, which cause the applied chirp signals to interfere arbitrarily. In this work, the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) is employed for the first time in dental imaging to separate chirp signals overlapping in both time and frequency domains. The overlapped chirps are compressed using the FrFT and matched filter techniques. Micro-computed tomography is used for validation of the ultrasound measurements for both techniques. For a human molar, the thickness of the enamel layer is measured with an average error of 5.5% after compressing with the FrFT and 13.4% after compressing with the matched filter based on the average speed of sound in human teeth.","tags":null,"title":"Diagnostic ultrasound tooth imaging using fractional Fourier transform","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"9eb50f9088083bebcb7e4cf99e22b9ed","permalink":"/news/","publishdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/","section":"","summary":"Keep Updated!","tags":null,"title":"News","type":"widget_page"}]
